# 1. Business Problem.

A Bank is experimenting a increase in numbers of customer churn and needs a way to reduce these numbers.

# 2. Business Assumptions.


# 3. Solution Strategy
- Explore data to:
    - Answer business questions
    - Generate Insights

- Create a ML classification model to predict customers that are more likely to churn
- Offer these customers discount coupons

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

**Step 01. Data Description:** Analyze Data briefly and its statistics to have a basic idea of the granularity and general info of the data.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** If possible derive new features from the dataset. There are not many features available so I don't expect new features to be derived.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** If there are some Irregularities, remove them.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data with respect to frequency, do a bivariate analysis with respect to response variable, analyze some business hypothesis to generate insights.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:** Apply methods to balance the dataset such as: oversampling, downsampling, SMOTE.

**Step 06. Feature Selection:** Select the most important features or all of them since we don't have many available.

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling:** Test different models and select the best in terms of performance and resource usage.

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:** Apply tunning to the parameters.

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values:** Calculate the revenue the model could generate if put into production.

**Step 10. Deploy Modelo to Production:** Deploy the model on a free cloud server building an API.
